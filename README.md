Marks a location on the map with an arrow that is viewable through a Augmented camera app.

This was a very interesting challenge for us, since we had no experience with AR developing.

There are many potential implementations that we can pursue with this.
We had two main ideas: 
    - Having an AR pointer to your car after you parked
    - Having an AR pointer whenever your Lyft ride is here, showing which car is yours to get in
  
  Both of these seemed very interesting to us and we worked towards implementing a representation of this
